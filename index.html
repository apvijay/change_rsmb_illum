      <p>
Change detection between two images in the presence of degradations is
an important problem in the computer vision community, more so for the
aerial scenario which is particularly challenging. Cameras mounted on
moving platforms such as aircrafts or drones are subject to general
six-dimensional motion as the motion is not restricted to a single
plane. With CMOS cameras increasingly in vogue due to their low power
consumption, the inevitability of rolling-shutter (RS) effect adds to
the challenge.  This is caused by sequential exposure of rows in CMOS
cameras unlike conventional global shutter cameras where all pixels
are exposed simultaneously. The RS effect is particularly pronounced
in aerial imaging since each row of the imaging sensor is likely to
experience a different motion. For fast- moving platforms, the problem
is further compounded since the rows are also affected by motion blur.
Moreover, since the two images are shot at different times,
illumination differences are common. In this paper, we propose a
unified computational framework that elegantly exploits the sparsity
constraint to deal with the problem of change detection in images
degraded by RS effect, motion blur as well as non-global illumination
differences. We formulate an optimization problem where each row of
the distorted image is approximated as a weighted sum of the
corresponding rows in warped versions of the reference image due to
camera motion within the exposure period to account for geometric as
well as photometric differences. The method has been validated on both
synthetic and real data.

<sec-contents><p>Given a reference image and an RSMB image of the same scene but with a different illumination, we estimate the row-wise camera motion between the two images and the multiplicative illumination factors to register them, and simultaneously detect the regions of changes between them. </p>
